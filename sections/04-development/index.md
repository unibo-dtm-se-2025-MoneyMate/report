# Development

## DVCS

The MoneyMate implementation is hosted in the repository  
[`unibo-dtm-se-2025-MoneyMate/artifact`](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2025-MoneyMate/artifact).

This section explains how we used Git and GitHub during development.

### Branch usage conventions

Our branch flow is **main → developer → feature/fix branches**:

- **`main`**
  - Release branch.
  - Only contains stable code that has passed tests and gone through the release pipeline.

- **`developer`**
  - Integration branch.
  - All feature and fix branches are merged here first.

- **Feature branches from `developer`**
  - We create short‑lived branches from `developer`, grouped by concern:
    - **Data layer** branches: modular data layer, unified API, thread‑safety, partial updates, idempotent deletes, balances.
    - **GUI** branches: initial GUI integration, login/registration screens, charts, transactions, etc.
    - Other technical branches (e.g. for hardening logging tests).
  - These branches are merged back into `developer` via pull requests.


### Commit message conventions

The repository uses a **conventional‑commit‑style** pattern for commit messages:

`<type>(<scope>): <description>`

Examples from the actual history:

- **Features like:**
  - [`88e57431`](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2025-MoneyMate/artifact/commit/88e57431d5a0a8e1cca1333940ece93d1dfb71e7)  
    `feat(gui/login): enhance login validation and integrate navigation to registration`

- **Fixes like:**
  - [`c5dd712e`](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2025-MoneyMate/artifact/commit/c5dd712e1f2d01c5eeb3196ce21a4716baf97354)  
    `fix(test/gui): mock correct modules, lazy-import GUI, and skip cleanly without Tk`

- **Chores like:**
  - [`f4443432`](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2025-MoneyMate/artifact/commit/f4443432ff74d528216fd9ff2e34492378cf7e3b)  
    `chore(pytest): add base pytest configuration with markers`

- **Tests like:**
  - [`96fb63f0`](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2025-MoneyMate/artifact/commit/96fb63f0b571b8ad527ad67b05a8f646302f7b3a)  
    `test(gui/login): add tests for successful, failed and missing-field login flows`

- **Documentation like:**
  - [`6dea704b`](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2025-MoneyMate/artifact/commit/6dea704b5f9b2da073a2fc45b389f91d3a4edb6f)  
    `docs(readme): Refine descriptions in README.md`

Release commits are automatically generated by semantic‑release:

- [`2d2b0236`](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se-2025-MoneyMate/artifact/commit/2d2b023607ee3058227dddfae4948f8c1207ce79)  
  `chore(release): 1.1.0 [skip ci]`

### Conventions for pull requests, issues, code reviews

Based on the merge commits:

- Feature work (data layer, GUI, API hardening, auditing, logging tests) is done on **topic branches** and merged into `developer` through **pull requests** like:
  - PR #3 – “user account support, deterministic listings, auditing, and category handling”
  - PR #4 – “safer API (thread-safe), partial updates, idempotent deletes, balances”
  - PR #7 – “Merge GUI Branch: Initial User Interface Integration”
- Releases are produced by merging `developer` into `main` via **PR**.

GitHub Actions runs on these PRs to execute tests and, when merging to `main`, to trigger the
semantic‑release flow (including publishing to PyPI).
